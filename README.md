# Chapter - 1


#  Introduction 

If you are a self-taught Data Engineer, then you know how hard and time consuming it is. 
To become a professional Data Engineer you would need to have knowledge on several topics like 
*   Learning how to code
*   Learning how to design the infrastructure for your application
*   Data Modelling 
*   Writing SQL to extract the information you need from the raw data
*   Process the large volume of data in the most efficient way.
*   And more...

For absolute new beginners, it can be daunting to organise all these vast topics, form a plan and learn it 
enough to start working on real-time projects. That is exactly what we will be tackling through this series of chapters. 
This series of chapters aim to cover from the very basics of data engineering from writing a simple 
production level application, optimising it and consider different ways of deploying an application on the cloud.

We will be following “learn by implementing”  approach. I will try and keep the theory to a minimum, 
as there are so many other blogs serving the purpose. 




# Scope of the tutorial 

Even though this tutorials initial few chapters covers the basics of Python & AWS, _this is NOT an extensive tutorial any single technology_, reference will be provided where suitable, 
We will be mainly focusing on putting different technologies together to solve real world problems.
