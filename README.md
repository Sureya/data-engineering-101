#  Introduction 

Self-taught Data Engineer, know how hard and time consuming it is to become a professional quality Data Engineer. To become one,  you would need to have knowledge on several topics like 

*	Learning how to code
*	Learning how to design the infrastructure for your application
*	Data Modelling 
*	Writing SQL to extract the information you need from the raw data
*	Process the large volume of data in the most efficient way.
*	Security best practices

For absolute new beginners, it can be daunting to organise all these vast topics, form a plan and learn it enough to start working on real-time projects. That is exactly what we will be tackling through this series of chapters.  This series of chapters aim to cover from the very basics of data engineering from writing a simple production level application, optimising it and consider different ways of deploying an application on the cloud. We will be following “learn by implementing”  approach. I will try and keep the theory to a minimum, as there are so many other blogs serving the purpose. 




# Scope of the tutorial 
This is not an extensive tutorial on all technologies, there are loads of good tutorials available to get started with each technology, Instead of covering all the topics in-depth,  we will be focusing on how to design the application requirements and how to put different technologies together to solve the problem. For all the technologies used, I will be adding reference links to get started. This is not a Data Science or Machine Learning related tutorials.
